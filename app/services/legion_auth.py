"""
One-tap sign-in for a member Virtus already knows about (from a Slack payload), skipping
Legion's username-entry form. Two mechanisms live here:

**Magic links (`make_link_url`) — preferred for anything we send into Slack.** Slack's
in-app browser (iOS and Android both) throws away cookies between opens, so a member
who signed in a minute ago arrives with no `mw_sso` and would face a fresh Approve/Deny
push on every single tap. A signed link carries the identity itself, so the cookie
never has to survive. See Legion's `services/sso.make_link_token`.

**Challenges (`start_challenge`) — the older Slack-push round trip.** Still used by
`/enter` (`app/routers/portal.py`) for links already sitting in Slack history from
before magic links existed, and as the path for anyone arriving without a token. See
Legion's `routers/sso.py` `POST /sso/challenge`.
